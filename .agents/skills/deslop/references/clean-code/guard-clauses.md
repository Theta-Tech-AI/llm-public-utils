# Guard Clauses

> "The guard clause says, 'This is rare, and if it happens, do something and get out.'"
> — Martin Fowler, *Refactoring*

Check for invalidate states at the start of a function and exit early when preconditions are not met. This keeps the "happy path" at outermost indentation and fails fast. Use it for null checks, empty inputs, invalid states, edge cases, or recursive termination. Use it to handle the unhappy cases early, not for selecting between equally weighted paths. For instance:

```python
# ❌ Wrong - Nested conditionals obscure the happy path
def get_pay_amount(employee):
    result = 0
    if employee.is_dead:
        result = dead_amount()
    else:
        if employee.is_separated:
            result = separated_amount()
        else:
            if employee.is_retired:
                result = retired_amount()
            else:
                result = normal_pay_amount()
    return result

# ✅ Correct - Guard clauses make special cases obvious
def get_pay_amount(employee):
    if employee.is_dead:
        return dead_amount()
    if employee.is_separated:
        return separated_amount()
    if employee.is_retired:
        return retired_amount()
    return normal_pay_amount()
```

```python
# ✅ Classic guard clause pattern
def send_welcome_email(user):
    if user is None:
        return
    if not user.email:
        return

    # Main logic at natural indentation
    mailer.send(user.email, "Welcome!")
```

```python
# ❌ Wrong - Guards belong at the top
def process(item):
    item.prepare()
    item.validate()
    if not item.is_ready:  # Too late
        return None
    return item.execute()

# ✅ Correct - Check preconditions first
def process(item):
    if not item.can_process:
        return None
    item.prepare()
    item.validate()
    return item.execute()
```

```python
# ❌ Misleading - Both branches are equally valid
def process_order(order):
    if order.is_express:
        return handle_express_shipping(order)
    return handle_standard_shipping(order)

# ✅ Better - if/else signals equal weight
def process_order(order):
    if order.is_express:
        handle_express_shipping(order)
    else:
        handle_standard_shipping(order)
```

In relation to other principles, guard clauses...

| Principle | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| [**Fail-Fast**](../reliability/fail-fast.md) | Guard clauses are fail-fast's implementation: detect problems immediately and exit |
| [**Cognitive Load**](cognitive-load.md) | Flattening nested conditionals reduces mental overhead |
| [**Small Functions**](small-functions.md) | Guards work best in small, focused functions |
| [**Design by Contract**](../reliability/design-by-contract.md) | Guards enforce preconditions at runtime |
